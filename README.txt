Welcome to my final computer systems project! 

To compile the program, run "make." It will save the executable as "fsm," which will take two command line arguments.

The unit  tests will run before the program begins running. 

All helper functions are included in fsmFunctions.c/fsmFunctions.h, which the makefile will compile with fsm.c

The makefile will also compile an executable called "fsmTest." This provides testing for valid output. 
The file fsmOutputTest.c explains what files to pass as command line arguments to test for different outputs.
All of the necessary input files are included here.
